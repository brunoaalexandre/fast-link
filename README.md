# About the project

This project is being developed during the Sujeito Programdor's classes. The real project called Sujeito Link, and mine called Fast Link. <br /><br />
It's a simple project where the user places a **long url** and the site returns a **short link** of **bit.ly**. <br/><br />
This project has been very good because the challenges I found it. For example: the real project is in JavaScript, I'm doing in TypeScript using <a href="https://github.com/vitejs/vite">ViteJS</a>, using some hooks like *useState* among others. <br /><br />
My idea is to help as many people with this project done is this way, using the things I used.<br /> <br />
So, that's all, folks! ‚ù§Ô∏è
